# Spam_email_classifier
Spam email classifier using different models and evaluating their accuracy scores.

This project is about using different models to predict either an email is spam or not. I have used five different models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.
The datasets I have used is taken from kaggle. The accuracy score, classification report along with confusion matrix are also output in the code, which helped me to determine which model to use for this datasets.
